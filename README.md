This repository contains sample plugins for [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme). 

See [yt-dlp plugins](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#plugins) for more details


## Installation
You can install this package with pip:
```
python3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/yt-dlp/ytdlp-sample-plugins/archive/master.zip
```

See [yt-dlp installing plugins](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installing-plugins) for the many other ways this can be installed.


## Developer Guide

### Run and debug configuration
1. Set your IDE's run configuration to run the `yt_dlp` Python module.
2. Add your project's root directory containing `ytdlp_plugins` to `PYTHONPATH` environment variable (this may not be necessary with some IDE run configurations)
3. The `ytdlp_plugins` folder should be automatically picked up by yt-dlp (run with `-v` to check)


### Importing extractors from other plugins

```py
from ytdlp_plugins.extractor.example import ExampleIE
```

This works regardless of where the `example` plugin is installed on the system, as long as yt-dlp can find it. 
Your IDE may not be able to resolve the import, but it will work at runtime.

If the user does not have the `example` plugin installed, the import will fail and your extractor will not be imported (but yt-dlp will continue to run). 

The same goes for any other plugin type.
